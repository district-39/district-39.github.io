Scotty: ?? Does Intergroup have the new rack qith the QR Codes?
Dave: how are you buying literature?
In amounts as neded or at certain times?
> as needed but some times a year
Are you buying at full cost or at discount?
> some discount
Can you merge with other groups to get an even lower discounts?
> no? 
...so some intergroups will merge and buy in bulk
> 7th tradition, we are self-supporting. At the end of the day it's the 
They seem to do it at a district level. I've seen it. It might save you some money and help IGR survive a little better? 
> We have a website set up you can go online and buy at cost
Do you have a QR code or anything?
> I'll get one

Ryan: Can you get them at groups? 
> that's what he's trying to get off the ground?
> we are going to need help because we have a huge amount to cover

Russel: how can we get you an order?
> email
Are you looking for a representative to be a liason?
> Scotty and Ryan volunteered (ad hoc subcomittee!)

MENTION QR CODE FOR GROUP TEXT BLAST SOMETHING

Ashley: Would we just tell you if there was something
> you can email or something
Will you come to the workshop?
> yes. 
Russel > we also have an IGR liason

### Ken ADCM 
39 minute IGR
- Shawn stepped down
- PI and Unity was open at the beginning of the meeting

finalizing P & L report and tuning up finance reporting
will be included

there's a website for the bookstore with online purchaces

election
Frank is new treasurer
Jimmy J is doing PI
Unity is still open
Alcathon is on November 27th, flyer is attached in notes

EPGSA - report notes will be attached

### Russel, DCM report
12/14 NEXT QUARTERLY MEETING - everyone is welcome
if you're there, tell Russel you have to be announced by your DCM as a guest
most things are very far away, but there's 2 things available re zoom meetings
- treatment accessability subcomittee 
- bridging the gap

reach out to delegate dan and express if you want the literature

if anyone is planning on going to EPGSA it's important to be counted at 9am, otherwise you can't be counted to vote. If not counted at 9am, your vote will not be counted.

proposal on the floor agenda: classify literature
- added at norassa (sp?) -> next voting will be on the board 
- before 1971 should not be touched, everything else is up for debate
- also category literature in:
	- recovery
	- founders
	- service

Dave
- look at what delegates are doing, you need to see how they act 

SCOTTY: should we request delegates to come to workshop? 
Russel: We can make a request for Dec 14th, any oppose? (no opposition)

Zach asked for information about what the classifications will be

## Group Concerns
ANGELA: 4th edition big book, some pages are not aligning depending on the date it was published; also noticed at the midvalley group (re: specific stories). Margins looked different in different books and an offset becomes apparent.
RUSSEL: we can motion that something be done about it, or we can put it into an action (that will make them aware). What was the expressed goal?
> The goal was not expressed; it was a screenshot recieved by the GSR
Bring back to group and ask 

Ryan: is the 5th edition coming out? Maybe it would be good to make them aware before it happens, maybe going into the 5th edition it could be made as a motion.
Dan: how about prefacing the book? instead of re-doing making a reference sheet

Scotty: (missed)

Russel: Area meetings are entered as floor agendas through paperwork (not )

## Old Business

## New Business
 > can send the whole thing out

 > send out options of email signups for websites
 > remind people if they want to sign up for the website, they can just send me their availablility

## Open Floor
noon, 4, 8 - 8pm will be a candelight meeting, you can hang out when a meeting isn't happening. Finding chairs is more difficult than keeping the building open.
the office plans to limit it to major holidays (actual schedule we can use to provide info) and what plans are for what holidays. Support for marathon meetings varies per holiday
!! looking for support that we're going to announce

>>> maybe send out additional email?
no flyer for christmas but please announce
