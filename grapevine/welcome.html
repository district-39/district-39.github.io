<h2>Welcome to the GVR Network</h2>
<br>A saGVR, you join thousands of other Grapevine representatives in the U.S. and Canada who form the link between the magazine and their group. Service is the heart of this position. As a GVR, you perform a service for AA members, making sure that information about Grapevine and La Viña is available to them and to your group. You also perform a service for Grapevine, linking the magazine to members of the Fellowship who, without you, might not read it or even know that AA has a journal at all.</br>
<br>In 1977, the General Service Conference recommended that delegates establish area Grapevine committees and work toward the goal of having a GVR in every group. All ninety-three service areas have an active area Grapevine chairperson in place.</br>
